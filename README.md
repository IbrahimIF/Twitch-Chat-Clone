This project is a real-time Twitch chat replica built using React + Vite and TypeScript, initially developed following a tutorial by @code-with-gionatha. 
It provides a dynamic messaging board where users can engage with each other in real-time using socket.io, simulating the interactive environment found on a live Twitch stream. This allows for immediate communication and community interaction, similar to a live chat alongside a streaming broadcast. Beyond the tutorial, this project has been enhanced with various features to improve user experience and functionality, making it a more robust and interactive chat platform.
