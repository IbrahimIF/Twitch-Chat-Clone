This project is a Twitch chat clone built with React + Vite, originally following a tutorial by @code-with-gionatha. 
It includes all core chat functionality like real-time messaging, user roles, and emote support. 
Beyond the tutorial, I've added hidden Easter eggs, Themes, and special features like animated messages and sound effects to make it more interactive and fun.
